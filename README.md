# Awesome-Chocolates-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
I developed a comprehensive project in Power Bi using excel as the data source. The dashboard offers insights into sales trends, profit distribution, shipment performance, top products, and salesperson contribution.
It is designed to help business teams track KPIs, identify high-performing products, and make data-driven decisions.
